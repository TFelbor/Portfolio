This is a readme file for the Short GUI application I’ve written. It’s an application that is meant to showcase my familiarity and proficiency with basic JavaFX tools.
This application utilizes techniques like:

JavaFX GUI programming, Event-Driven programming, Inheritance & Polymorphism,  Parsing JSON Objects 

Below is a scene-by-scene analysis of what each presents and how each looks like when the application is run.
1. First Scene prompts the user with the login screen. After entering the appropriate login and password, the user is sent to the home screen.
2. The homescenedisplaystheoptionsofwheretheusercangowithinthe application. After a click on the button, the user is sent to the scene
   corresponding with the button. 
4. This chat scene prompts the user with an emptys croll pane in the middle of the window, which fills up with a chat conversation as
   the user clicks the buttons that initialize the ‘conversation’.
6. This scene allows the user to lookup the price of a stock they wish, displaying it in the center of the scene. If the user clicks on
   the ‘Reset & Try a different symbol’ button, the current stock being displayed and its price are moved to the left under ‘Previously looked up’,
   freeing the center space for another symbol to be searched. 
8. This scene presents the user with a calculator. Using the organized buttons, user can calculate a mathematical equation which product will be
   displayed between the title and the buttons.
10. Lastly the ‘Logout’ button will take the user to the login scene, and the 'Exit' button will stop running the application and quit.
